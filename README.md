# Employee_Database_Analysis---SQL

For this project, I utilized PostgreSQL as the primary database system. Initially, I established a database named "employee_db," comprising six tables: "departments" (9 rows, 2 columns), "department_employee" (331,603 rows, 4 columns), "department_manager" (24 rows, 4 columns), "employee" (300,024 rows, 6 columns), "salary" (1,141,783 rows, 4 columns), and "title" (443,308 rows, 4 columns).

Subsequently, I established a connection between the PostgreSQL database and Python within the Jupyter Notebook environment. Leveraging this connection, I executed queries, presenting their outcomes through graphical representations to enhance comprehension.

The addressed queries encompassed the following inquiries:

1.Find counts of each and every table.
2.Which department has the highest average salary of active employees ? Give some plots to show the avg salary department-wise.
3.Which title has the highest avg salary? Give some plots to show the avg salary title-wise.
4.Distribution of salary across titles.
5.Distribution of salary across departments.
6.How many active managers in each department. Is there any department with no manager?
7.Composition of titles department-wise. Appropriate plots.
8.Composition of departments title-wise. Appropriate plots.
9.Salaries of active department managers. Which department's manager who is active earns the most?
10.What are the titles of active department managers? Are they managers only?
11.Past history of salaries of managers across department (yearly)
12.Distribution of salaries of active employees working for more than 10 years vs 4 years vs 1 year.
13.Average number of years employees work in the company before leaving (title wise).
14.Average number of years employees work in the company before leaving (Dept wise).
15.Median annual salary increment department wise.
